Let 1
* Internets
    * End systems（edge） + links + routers（core）
    * Interconnected ISPs
* Protocol
    * Request + response
    * Formats of exchanging the messages + actions 
    * How the message exchanging process is formatted in one process( SMTP, HTTP, TCP, UDP, POP)
* Access networks:
    * DSL:use telephone line (telephone network)
    * Cable: use cable(TV), share one access network
    * wireless
* Hosts(function)
    * Sending, break into packets , L(bits), R(transmission rate) L/R transmission delay
* Switching:
    * Packet-switching(On demand allocation)
Store and forward: takes all before transmit, takes L/R to push out one packet
    * Circuit switching(reserved resources)
        * Must allocate one resource for end to end.
            * FDM, TDM
    * Queue and lost: 
                    Router has a queue to hold the packets
* Network core 
    * Routing : determine the road
    * Forwarding : move to the next station
Lec2
* ISP
* Delays:
    * Nodal processing
    * Queuing delay(vary): depends on a(average packet arrival rate)
    * Transmission delay(push out): L/R
    * Propogation delay(time on the link): 
* Throughput:
    * The transfer rate between sender and receiver
* Layering:
    * 5 layers
    * App: support  applications
    * Transport: support data transfer
    * Network: routing
    * link: (no idea)
    * Physical: bits
* Security:
    * Dos:
Lec3
* Application:
    * run on.different end systems
    * Communicate through network
* Architecture:
    * Client-server: server(may be data centers) wait for call(from clients)
    * P2P: peer request and also provide service
* Process (running programs)
    * Communicate through messages (defined by protocols_
    * Socket: A door send message or receive message
    * Process address: IP: host address , port numbers(services): 
* Transport service:
    * Data integrity, timing, throughput, security
* TCP, UDP (tranport protocol)
    *  TCP: data reliable, flow control, congestion control, connection-oriented.
        * Will send a message back to ensure it gets the packet
    * UDP: not reliable, but with high speed
        * Won’t send
* Securing 
    * SSL TCP and UDP do not have security
* HTTP
    * client-server
    * 
        * Initiate TCP connection
        * accepts
        * Exchange message 
        * Closes
    * Two different
        * Non-persistent( one object each time)
            * Response time: 2RTT + transmutation time
            * Process
                * Initiate on a IP + port (Client)
                * Server at the port accepts the connection (Server)
                * Send request (Client)
                * Receive the message, forms a response message and send to the socke (S)
                * Close TCP connection (S)
                * Receive the object (Client)
        * Persistent (multiple objects each time)
Lec 4
* Message Formats
    * request
        * Request + Header + Body
        * Post, Get: post send message from the body, get from the URL 
    * response
        * Status code (for information)
    * Cookies (for user-server state) (whiten http message)
        * SET COOKIE (from server response) in the same time create ID in cookie database
        * Next time ( server will know more about you clients):
            * Request with cookie will get cookie action
* Caches ( satisfy the request but without using the origin server which is slow)
    * First send the request to the proxy server
    * Get the response from proxy server, if not get , send the request to the original server and get it from there
Lec5
* E-mail
    * User-agent: 
    * Mail servers:
        * Contains messages
        * Message queue for outgoing messages
        * SMTP: sending servers( clients), receiving servers (servers)
    * Scenario
        * A sends to B
        * A’s UA sends the e-mail to the mail server, put it in the message queue
        * Client opens TCP connection with B server
        * Using SMTP, A sends message to B over the TCP
        * B place it in the mailbox
        * The user can see the e-mail from the user-agent
    * SMTP format
    * Mail Access protocols:
        * POP IMAP HTTP
* DNS
    * DNS goals
        * Host name to IP
        * Host aliasing
        * One host name to many iPs (load distribution)
    * Process:
        * Basic process
            * Root -> .com.            
            * Com -> amazon.com (TLD)
            * Amazon.com -> IP
        * Two different process
            * Iterative (I don’t know ,ask him plz)
            * Recursive( I will help you ask him and get it back to you)
    * DNS records
        * A : name -> IP
        * NS: domain -> server
        * CNAME: alias name -> real name
        * MX: mail server
    * DNS messages
Lec 6
* Client-server.  Dcs 
* P2P.                Dp2p
* Bitorrent
    * The tracker randomly select a subset of peers
    * At any time, A will ask the chunks they have. And request using tcp connections for chunks he doesn’t have.
    * Which chunk to request first, which neighbors should he request ? Which she should respond to?
        * Ask for the chunks that are rarest (least copies in neighbors) -> redistributed quickly
        * Give priority to the neighbors which supply data In the highest rate.(top 4)
        * Also randomly choose one neighbor to supply data.
* DHT(X)
Lec 7
* Video streaming
    * DASH
        * SERVER
            * Divide into chunks
            * Each chunk encoded in different rates.
            * URL for each chunk
        * CLIENT
            * Measure bandwidth
            * Request one chunk one time: choose the max coding rate based on the bandwidth
    * Client strategy
        * When to request
        * Coding rate choice
        * Where to request: choose the highest bandwidth server
    * CDN ( store  multiple copies of videos at different sites )
        * Push deep ( near users)
    * CDN example
        * Store one copy to different nodes
        * Client retrieve content from different nodes
    * CDN content access:
        1. Get the URL for the video
        2. DNS -> IP(KING CDN)
        3. Request KING CDN server
    * Server selection startegy
        * Learns the IP of bob
        * Assign bob to the server which is closest  ( geo database)
    * Netflix ( Using amazon cloud )
        * Amazon cloud: contains webpage + videos in different rates
        * Uploads videos to CDN
        * Cloud determine the best CDN for the request
        * Send manifest and CDN IP to client
        * Client CDN interact using DASH
Lec 8
* Overview
    * Service: logical communication.   Process to process( in the application layer’s view, actually it is the network layer to send data between hosts)
    * Protocols:
        * Send: message -> segments.  Break down and add headers
        * Receive: segments -> message.
    * Relationship between network layer:
        * Process to process vs. host to host. 
        * process -> transport layer -> network -> in some manner -> network -> transport -> process
    * UDP TCP:
        * Network: IP best effort delivery service
        * Service model:
            * Transport layer multiplexing      分开
            * Demultiplexing                          收集
* Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
    * How
        * UDP start port + dest port -> check the dest port -> go to the right port
            * Stort port is for sending back
            * One port a lot of ports send to it
        * TCP  4 items define a tupe = one socket (2 IP + 2 port)
                * Give each process one socket
* UDP:
    * benefits
        * No connection establishment
        * simple
        * Smal header size
        * No cogestión control
    * Check sum:
        * Used for checking
